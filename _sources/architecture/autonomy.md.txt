# Autonomy Architecture

## Mapping & Autonomous Task - Australian Rover Challenge 2025

### General Overview

- **Focus:** Autonomous exploration and mapping, navigation to specific landmarks.

### Key Elements

#### Autonomous Phase

- **Start Condition:** Rover must autonomously exit the start area for points.
- **Navigation:** 
  - Task: Navigate to five placards using a pre-provided schematic.
  - **Points:** 6 points per placard imaged and relayed to judges.
- **Rules:** 
  - No manual control once rover begins moving.
  - Interventions move to non-autonomous phase.

#### Non-Autonomous Phase

- Teams can take manual control anytime, for further exploration or troubleshooting which ends the ability to gather points in the autonomous phase.

#### Exploratory Mapping

- **Objective:** Locate four 100x100x100mm cubes (red, green, blue, white).
- **Points:** 
  - 5 points for each cube located within 300mm accuracy.
  - 2 points if within 600mm.
  - Double points if reported during autonomous phase.

#### Data and Mapping Restrictions

- All mapping data must be gathered during the task; no prior arena knowledge allowed.

#### Presentation

- **Autonomous Navigation Design:** 
  - Discuss the autonomous system's design, advantages, and limitations.
- **Mapping System Design:** 
  - Explain mapping navigation methods.
  - Justify autonomy level, map format, and feature choices.
- **Map Visualization:** 
  - Present arena map, judged for coverage, completeness, resolution, and accuracy.
- **Points:** Up to 25 points for the quality of the presentation.

### Scoring and Penalties

- Points for navigation success, cube location accuracy, and presentation.
- Penalties for autonomous phase collisions or exiting arena requiring E-STOP activation.

This task emphasizes autonomous operation, navigation, and mapping, with a focus on practical application of robotics in space exploration scenarios.
