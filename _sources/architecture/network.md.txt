# Details and attributes of Perseus's Network

## TLDR

SSID is "QUTRC-ROAR" and assume only a 20Mhz connection.

## Purpose

Some of the software written for Perseus will operate better if details of the network Perseus operates on are known.
This file seeks to capture these details

## Wifi Network Assumptions

The wifi network that Perseus can see has the following attributes
SSID for 2.4Ghz: "QUTRC-ROAR"
SSID for 5Ghz: "QUTRC-ROAR"
Hard-wired ethernet operation also needs to be accommodated

During competition:
Either 20 Mhz band on nominated Channel 1 or Channel 11.
OR
40Mhz band on either 1-5 or 9-13

During Practice:
20 or 40 Mhz band centered on channel 6

Assumption: All systems need to be able to concurrently operate on 20Mhz (Max ~97 Mbps)
