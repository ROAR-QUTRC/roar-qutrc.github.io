# Software Standards

This document is intended to codify a set of standards and practices for developing high-quality and interoperable software and firmware across the QUT Robotics ROAR team. Before writing any software, you should have fully read through both the [General](project:/standards/software/general.md) and language-specific ([C++](project:/standards/software/cpp.md), [Python](project:/standards/software/python.md), [JS/TS](project:/standards/software/typescript.md)) sections.
Additionally, if you're writing ROS or Svelte code, you should also have read through the relevant sections of the [framework standards](project:/standards/software/frameworks.md) section.
If you don't fully understand some of the topics being referenced, feel free to ask questions in Discord, we'll be happy to help, and if enough people have the same questions, we'll edit this document to add explanations.

- c++ standards are heavily based off the [OpenStack C++ standards](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CppCodingStandards).
- JS/TS standards are heavily based off [MDN Developer Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Code_style_guide/JavaScript).
