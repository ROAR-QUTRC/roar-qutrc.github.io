# Python Standards

Just follow the conventions in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008). A couple of the most important notes are:

- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Variables: `snake_case` variable names
- 4 space indentation

Everything in the general standards section still applies, and if there is a conflict between PEP 8 and what's specified in this document, this document takes priority.

## Formatting

### Formatter

Use the _[Black](https://github.com/psf/black)_ formatter with default settings.
