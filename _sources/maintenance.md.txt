# Maintenance

This section contains the information you need to know to keep the rover software, documentation, and electronics updated and running long-term.
If you don't read through these documents and understand what you're doing, you're liable to either break things, make it progressively harder to maintain, or both!

Before reading through any documents in this section, you should at the very least have read through its partner in the [Architecture](project:/architecture.md) section, otherwise it probably won't make much sense.
These documents are not intended to tell you what you need to know to _develop_ in the systems and _modify_ them - they are intended to give you the information you need to _keep_ an already operation system running as best it can and to _update_ it, as well as what the original intentions were when designing it if not already detailed in the architecture.
