# Getting Started

This project is built using [Nix](https://nixos.org/), which makes getting started quite easy - all you have to do is install Nix and `direnv`, and they take care of the rest.
Whilst this page will get you started, it is strongly recommended that you read through <project:nix-basics.md> after reading through this document so you understand how to use the tooling.

## First-time Setup

1. Install the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md).
2. Run the following shell commands to install `curl` and `direnv` (this assumes a Debian-based distro like Ubuntu):

```{code-block} console
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gh git curl direnv
```

3. Log into GitHub: `gh auth login -w -p https`
4. Clone the repo (into `~/perseus-v2`):

```{code-block} console
cd ~
gh repo clone ROAR-QUTRC/perseus-v2 # download the repository
```

5. Run the setup script (it will prompt you for sudo permissions): `~/perseus-v2/software/scripts/nix-setup.sh`
6. Restart your shell
7. Run `cd ~/perseus-v2`
8. Accept all config options when prompted with `y`
9. Wait for the downloads (and potentially builds)
10. Run `nix build` - this will attempt to build the workspace. If this succeeds, you're done, and the built workspace is now available under the `./result` folder!

### IDE Setup

#### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)

Open the `perseus-v2/perseus-v2.code-workspace` workspace file (`File/Open Workspace from File`) and install all the recommended extensions.
This will install language support extensions (Python and C++), an extension for the formatter in use ([`treefmt`](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt) - configured using [`treefmt-nix`](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt-nix/)), and configure VSCode to respect the project settings.

:::{important}
You specifically need to open the `perseus-v2.code-workspace` file, not the folder, as otherwise settings won't apply.
In the event that you open the folder by mistake, VSCode will prompt you to open the workspace file:

![VSCode Prompt](open-code-workspace.png)

Once you've opened the workspace, you should see `(WORKSPACE)` in your explorer (file view) title.
:::

Unfortunately, due to limitations in how `treefmt` works, it can only format files on save - this is fine, don't worry if you hit format and nothing happens.
Save it and try again!

At this point, you're all set up and ready to go.

#### Other (I)DEs

In the event that you're using another editor, you probably have enough technical know-how to set it up yourself.
As long as it uses the environment variables from the `direnv` setup, it should be able to find and run everything.
You should also configure your editor to use `treefmt` as its formatter - if you're using `direnv` or you're in a `nix develop` environment (see the [next sections](#developing-software)), it (and the formatters it uses internally) will already be available in your shell.
Finally, you should configure your C/C++ LSP provider to recursively search in `${ROS_WORKSPACE_ENV_PATH}/include` [^env-path] as part of its include path.
:::{example}
VSCode is configured with the include path `${env:ROS_WORKSPACE_ENV_PATH}/include/**` added.
`${env:...}` tells it to substitute the value of that environment variable as-is, the `/include/` is simply directing it to the correct subdirectory, and finally `**` tells it to recursively search through all directories for files to include.
:::

[^env-path]: `ROS_WORKSPACE_ENV_PATH` is an environment variable which gets set containing the path to the ROS environment in the Nix store. It contains all the tools and dependencies which get made available in the development environment.

:::{note}
You don't need to do anything Python support - the workspace sets `PYTHONPATH` by default.
:::

## Building the software

Run `nix build`.
That's it.
No, really.
If that succeeds, that means that the entire project built successfully and you can now use it.
However, at this point, it's not available on your shell - `nix build` creates a symlink named `result` in your current working directory which links to whatever you just built.
If, instead, you want to build the software and have it available to you, run `nix shell` instead.
After this runs, you'll be dropped into a sub-shell with the built rover packages available to you.
:::{note}
:name: setup-autocomplete
Unfortunately, `nix shell` can't set up autocomplete for ROS2 commands - if you want this functionality (which you should!) either run `eval "$(mk-workspace-shell-setup)"` or `source software/scripts/autocomplete.sh` (the path for the latter assumes you're in the repository root) after entering the subshell.
:::
At this point, you can run standard ROS2 commands, and all the rover packages are available like they've been installed.

## Developing Software

`direnv` automatically makes all the tools you need available to you when you `cd` into the repo.
Like `nix shell` however, it unfortunately can't set up autocomplete, so you'll need to set it up just like [above](#setup-autocomplete) every time you enter the directory.
However, if you don't like `direnv` - or you don't want to set up autocomplete - you can alternatively run `nix develop` to be dropped into a `bash` shell with everything fully set up, including autocomplete.
In this environment, you can either run `nix build` to build the entire workspace, or you can `cd` to the ROS workspace root `software/ros_ws` and run `colcon build` just like you're developing in a standard ROS2 environment.
:::{important}
You must **always** run `colcon` inside the workspace root `software/ros_ws`, otherwise the configuration file may not apply properly.
:::
:::{note}
To the experienced ROS2 developers - you may notice the lack of a `--symlink-install` flag on the `colcon build` command - that's because it's configured using a [`colcon_defaults.yaml`](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/configuration.html#defaults-yaml) file present at `software/ros_ws/colcon_defaults.yaml` which adds this flag by default.
:::

### Before you start

However, before you start writing code, there's a few things you need to read through first.
The most important one is the software [architecture](project:/architecture/software.md), which goes over how all the software links together and how it's laid out.
The other document is the software [standards](project:/standards/software.md), which details the standards to which your software is expected to be written.
If your software _doesn't_ meet these standards, we unfortunately won't be able to merge your changes until you fix the issues - if code standards aren't enforced, the code **will** quickly become an un-maintainable mess, leading to another rewrite.

## Debugging

### ROS2 Nodes can't see each other on the network

Use the `talker` and `listener` nodes from the `demo_nodes_cpp` package to test this, with the talker on one device and the listener on another.
For some reason, the `ros2 multicast` commands mentioned in the standard ROS [troubleshooting guide](inv:ros#How-To-Guides/Installation-Troubleshooting) use a different port to the actual ROS2 DDS communications layer, and as such is not a reliable way to test - hence the use of `talker` and `listener` nodes.
This is almost certainly caused by firewall issues - specifically, blocking DDS discovery.
To allow ROS2 through the firewall on a system managed with `ufw`, run the following commands:

```{code-block} console
sudo ufw allow in proto udp to 224.0.0.0/4
sudo ufw allow in proto udp from 224.0.0.0/4
```

If you're on a system with a firewall _not_ managed by `ufw`, you probably already know how to do this yourself.
You need to allow UDP traffic to and from the address `224.0.0.0` with a mask of 4 bits (hence `224.0.0.0/4`), as this is the mask for [multicast addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address).
:::{note}
In some cases, you may need to allow specific UDP ports through the firewall as well - if you're still having issues, let us know!
We'll help you debug it.
You can find a calculator for the ports in use [here](inv:ros#Concepts/Intermediate/About-Domain-ID) - just make sure to plug in the correct domain ID, as per the next section.
:::

### I installed ROS2 the normal way!

Firstly, you should really be using the Nix setup as it manages dependencies for you automatically.
It coexists perfectly happily with a standard ROS install, as it takes priority over your normal system-installed packages.
Secondly, you will probably probably experience `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` mismatches - this project defaults the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` to 51 for development, and 42 for production deployment, since this ensures that packages in development can't interfere with those running on the rover.
:::{note}
If you set the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` environment variable manually, it will be used instead of the defaults in the dev shell.
:::

## Setup script details

For the curious among you, the `nix-setup.sh` script, in order:

- Sets up git submodules (should never be necessary, but better to have it and not need it)
- [Installs Nix](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
- Configures Nix to allow your user to configure _it_ (adds you to `trusted-users`)
  % TODO: This needs to be changed - the repo Cachix paths should be added to `trusted-substituters` instead, since `trusted-users` apparently has _many_ security issues.
- Adds `direnv` setup to your `.zshrc` and `.bashrc` files
- Allows `direnv` to configure based on the `.envrc` file present in this directory
- Configures `direnv` to silence absurdly long info messages on activation [^direnv-versioning]

[^direnv-versioning]: This requires a modern version of `direnv` - if you see a text wall when it activates, you probably need a newer version. The standard version shipped with Ubuntu 22.04 is unfortunately too old for this to work.

:::{warning}
This script cannot set up direnv if you're not using `bash` or `zsh` as your shell!
You'll have to set up the hook yourself according to its [docs](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html), or use `nix develop` instead (see [Developing](#developing-software)).
:::

It's also designed to be able to run multiple times if something goes wrong - it checks if the modifications it makes are already present, and if it detects them, skips that step.
