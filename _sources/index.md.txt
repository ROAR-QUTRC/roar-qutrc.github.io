# Home

Welcome! This is the home of the Perseus Rover documentation. It contains (well, it should, if people have been updating it) everything you need to know about building software and electronics for the rover.

If you're new here, you'll probably be wanting to read through the <project:home/getting-started.md> page, which contains everything you need to know to start building software for the rover. Alternatively, if you're instead arms-deep in the rover's guts and wondering where that wire goes, or you're interested in designing electronics to go on-board the rover, check out the <project:architecture/electrical.md>. Finally, if you're wondering what a specific bit of code does, you probably want the <project:architecture/software.md> overview, or alternatively there's the auto-generated <project:generated/index.rst>.
