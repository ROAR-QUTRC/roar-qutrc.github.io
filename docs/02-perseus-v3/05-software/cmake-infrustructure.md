# CMake Build Infrastructure

This project's C++ code (excluding the firmware) is actually targeted at being built in two different ways - first by using Nix, and second by using ordinary `cmake` and `make` commands, each of which has a slightly different environment.

The first major difference between Nix and standard builds is how dependencies are handled.
When the project is built using Nix, all of the dependencies that a target specifies are made available to it as if they've already been installed, so the project can build with no particular extra steps.
However, when built through CMake normally, the individual projects need to manually add the subdirectories of their dependencies.
They can detect whether a package is already present (installed) using the `find_package` command, and only attempt to manually include their dependencies if they aren't already available.

The other major difference is related to the [build type](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html).
When you run CMake manually, there is by default no `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` specified.
In this case, the projects have some additional config in their `CMakeLists.txt` files to default to the `Debug` build type.
Nix builds, by contrast, _specify_ the `Release` build type.
This matters because these projects add `-Werror` to the GCC build flags for `Release` builds, thus enforcing the [no warnings](project:/standards/software/general.md#warnings-are-not-acceptable) section of the software standards.

If you're curious what all this looks like in practice, check out the `software/templates/` directory.

!!! note

    Under the hood, Nix's [`stdenv.mkDerivation`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-using-stdenv) automatically detects and uses CMake for these projects.

## Testing

Individual projects are unit tested using [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) (AKA GTest).
This is the default testing solution supported for ROS2 projects, as documented [here](inv:ros#Tutorials/Intermediate/Testing/Cpp).
It works well enough that we're also using it for unit testing the shared and native software.
